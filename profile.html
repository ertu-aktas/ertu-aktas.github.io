            I like working with computers. It's very fascinating to me how all these parts work together to form one
            complete system capable of doing most of the things we ask of them.
            In essence, it's similair to humans. The whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. That fascination makes
            gives me curious and motivated to uncover more of this field.
            It's all still very new and the advancements are made so fast, it's hard to keep up. I don't know exactly
            what
            I'd like to do after I get my diploma, but I am interested specifically in VR techonology.
            I can only imagine the possibilities it opens up. For example, it could be used by medicine students to
            analyze body parts close up and have like a bubble of text showing up explaining things about that body
            part.
            Or maybe help people with trauma learn to cope better with it. I don't think VR will take over the world, I
            do
            think that'll it'll be a nice addition to our learning and living environment.

          <li><strong>SWOT:</strong></li>
          <p class="first">
            Worrying is like a natural emotion of mine. I'm always conscience of the little things that can go wrong.
            Sometimes I manage to push this worry away from me, but then i become too careless and become worried again.
            It's almost cyclical. As you mentioned in the feedback, sometimes it indeed is the lack of information and
            understanding which becomes frustrating. But when it comes to understanding, I'm not afraid to ask and ask
            and
            ask untill i understand.
            Some people can get very frustated with me because of that. If I don't understand, then I say that I don't
            understand. I don't care if someone has to explain something to me a million times. If I want to know then
            I'll go on asking and asking and asking.
            I guess that that's the part of my perfectionist side. My mother is very much a perfectionist as well, so I
            know from who I got that. I have had instances where my perfectionism has held me back, especially in my
            musical career.
