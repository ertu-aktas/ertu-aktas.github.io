      <p class="properp"> The feedback I got from Elio was very positive. I showed him my site as well as my code, all of it's contents and elaborated a bit on how I could very easily change something if need be. There were some problems with the indentation of my code as it wasn't uniform across all pages. I thought it changed for all pages if you changed it for one, but that didn't appear to be the case. Besides that, I was advised to split my CSS file into multiple files and link them to their respective pages. This was because I have one CSS file but sometimes changing something in a class will conflict with some other classes. Rendering some lines of code as useluss or a duplicate. Furthermore, I have to remove the spaces in my file names as this could be cause for trouble later on. 
        I made one bad mistake and that is forgetting about one important post on the blog page. It was about the ICT-field analysis. I did not add it because I wasn't even aware that this had to be part of the blog posts. It somehow flew totally over my head. But nonetheless I do know about the workings of two companies who I admire. Valve and Stress Level Zero. Both game development companies who I look up to and would like to have the same workflow as. Namely working in smaller teams and having lots of creative freedom with how you go about your work. I was able to elaborate and explain my thoughts on it very well as Elio seemed to be satisfied with my answer regarding this ICT-field. I will update my blog page with this content. 
        After reviewing my side and my code I explained and showed my motivation for the ICT course.
      </p>
      <p class="properp">
        The motivation I put in the "Who Am I?" document isn't  really relevant anymore as my views and motivation as to why I want to do this have changed slightly. I'm not really sure what I want to become after finishing the ICT course. I have however realized that writing code and building algorithms is really fun when you understand it. My scope is still very small but that what I do understand and have seen, keeps on motivating me to keep on trying untill I do finally get it right. 
        I think my motivation can also be seen through my behaviour. Showing up to class, asking questions, keeping up with homework and actively looking for help when it's needed (and it's needed a lot). Furthermore, I have personal reasons to motivate me to keep on doing ICT and getting better at programming. I don't have that many options regarding a posistive future outlook and career choice. Through the last 3 years I have seen and experienced a lot. One of which was working fulltime in a factory. It was fun work, but it showed me how important it was to get a diploma and enjoy the work you do. A little bit of a tangent, but I had this very old coleague who has been doing that for all of his life. He comes to work as if it is his home, he loves it that much. I want to enjoy my work in ICT just as much as my coleague enjoys his work.  
        All in all it was a very pleasant assessment. The feedback I got will be very helpfull for my future developement. Besides that, it also made me reflect a lot upon myself and the motivation I have for this study.

        These two are Valve and Stress Level Zero. They both started as game developement companies. After valve created steam, they branched out towards other branches like publishing and hosting their own digital distribution platform, named steam. 
        They both have characterstics which I would describe as befitting my own view on what kind of company I would like to work in or do an internship in. One reason is the freedom they have in their work, namely valve. 
        They have wheels under their desks so that they may move over to whatever project they feel like working on. This is a testament to their freedom. 
        They can have this freedom only because of their lucrative platform steam is raising enough funds for them to experiment and make mistakes. This freedom however does come at a cost. 
        A phenomena has been named after the way in which valve decides to release their products, it's called "valve time". Because valve has this freedom, they can do whatever they want. 
        Even if it's a non realistic idea which is likely to never be published. But on the other side of the coin, because they have this freedom, everything they make is of the highest quality. 
        You can really feel the effort and passion that goes into what they make. After completion of their games, you unlock the developer commentary. 
        In which the developers themselves go into the thought process of how a peticulair section of the game is designed, what problems they faced and the solutions they came up with and how the play testers responded to them.

        Stress Level Zero is a VR game developer. They are the most known for making boneworks. Their games can be better classified as physics simulations. their aim is to create a truly believable world which acts and responds in the same manner our own would do.
        from everything like interacting with objects in a believable way to inserting your own body size so your real life hands line up with your ingame avatar. Making it all the more believable. 
        They are a small group of 20 people and I would like to work like that as well. In an intimate group of coleagues who you can trust and rely upon. 
        I don't think I'll end up becoming a game developer, but the way these two companies work is applicable to all companies. 
        In my work I'd like to have freedom (to a limited (but acceptable) degree), have a healthy work environment and coleagues of the same mind.
