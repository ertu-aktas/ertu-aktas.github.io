                <p class="aboutme">
                    My name is Ertugrul Aktas, currently I'm 22 years of age. I was born in Vlissingen and raised in
                    Middelburg. I am from the Netherlands. I mainly enjoy listening to music and doing activities with my friends.
                    I went to the high school Nehalennia Breeweg for about eight years before dropping out. The school year after that, I managed to
                    earn my HAVO diploma at scalda through the VAVO program.

                    Working with computers is one of the joys in life for me. There is no logical reasoning behind it.
                    I just really enjoy it for what it is. Computers are very intricate machines, making it able to 
                    do something simple like showing a letter or calculating 1+1 is an enormous task. At least it used to be. 
                    Computers can do more these days than being a big calculator. I want to know just how much they can do. 
                    I'm looking forward to learning about all the secrets of this machine. And if possible,
                    contribute to it's development. Being able to help advance this technology in any way whatsoever would 
                    be a dream come true for me. 
                </p>
